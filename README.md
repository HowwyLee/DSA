# Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Material
Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Learning Material repository! This repository is designed to provide comprehensive resources for learning and basic data structures and algorithms concepts.

# Introduction
This section provides an overview of the purpose and content of the learning material. It explains the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms in computer science and software development.

# Content Structure
* Data Structures: This section covers various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. Each data structure includes detailed explanations, implementation examples, and exercises.

* Algorithms: This section explores fundamental algorithms including sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort), searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search), graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search), and dynamic programming algorithms.
